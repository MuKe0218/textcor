Our project is to create low-cost conversation-based language courses and launch them on Udemy.\n\nInitially we will produce 120 dialogs in 12 different languages and launch the courses. \n\nAfter that we will continue to produce dialogs until we reach 1200 conversations. We plan to do this in 10 months.\n\nThat is, each month we will add 120 new conversations to our course until we reach 1200.\n\nThese will be the largest language courses on Udemy.\n\nEach package with 120 dialogues has an average of 2500 strings, with half for male voice and half for female voice.\n\nOur courses will offer audio, transcription, translation and pause for repetition, divided into 4 sessions. In addition students will also have access to mp3 files and ebooks with the course content and activities on a memorization platform.\n\nYour job:\n\n- Record around 1250 strings with your smartphone per month (10 months);\n- Save files with the name indicated in the spreadsheet;\n- Share files via Google Drive.\n- You will have to record the course description whenever necessary.\n\nYour earnings:\n\n- You will receive a $5 token to join our team and we will start the contract.\n- After that you will get a 5% share of the revenue share passed on by Udemy.\n- You will receive commissions on all Chinese language courses. Both, for those who want to learn German, and for those who speak German and want to learn another language.\n- In total you will receive commission on up to 22 courses (CH>BR, CH>EN, CH>FR, FR>CH, ES>CH, IT>CH, and so on.)\n- This is a lifetime commission.\n- You will be paid based on sales commissions only.\n- Milestones will be created and will be released as commission amounts are reached.\n- You must stay with us until the end of the project (1,200 conversations) to receive your lifetime commission.\n\nOur course will cost between $10-$20. Our expectation is to receive $5 for each course. So for every 1000 courses sold you get $250. Just do the math. \n\nBut these are just projections, we have the capacity to sell thousands of courses. Go to the Udemy website and see the performance of the top selling language courses to get a sense.\n\nYou will have full access to course performance reports directly on the Udemy website.\n\nRecordings:\n\n- We will point you to a mobile app to make recordings quick and easy.\n- You must use headphones (mic) to record.\n- You will receive a spreadsheet with the string that must be recorded and the respective name of the file to be saved.\n- Each file must contain only one string and no pauses at the beginning or end.\n- The recording must be done in a quiet place (the ideal would be to record inside a car for better soundproofing).\n- Record the string in a natural voice and with intonation according to the context of the conversation.\n- You only need to record the sentence only once. We will do all the editing and synchronization work to create the course sessions.\n- You will have 20 days to record the strings, they will be recorded as they are written.\n\n*** To apply, record the strings below and send them to us.
